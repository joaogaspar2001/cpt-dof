Filename: next_vit.py
Added to Project: 14-Oct-2023
Description: This module contains functions and methods to utilize and potentially modify the NextViT model 
             from the timm library for specific use cases. The functions modify the forward passes and 
             potentially other mechanisms to adapt the model to particular application needs.
